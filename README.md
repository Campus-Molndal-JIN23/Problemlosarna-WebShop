## Description
A fullstack e-commerce, Maven Springboot RESTful API application where you as a registered user can buy <i>super</i> random stuff. The application uses both a frontend and a backend in multiple modules.

The backend is built with Java and Springboot and the frontend with Thymeleaf and HTML. The application uses a MySQL database to store data.

Other features in the project are Spring Security, JWT, various Unittests, CSS and Javascript.
