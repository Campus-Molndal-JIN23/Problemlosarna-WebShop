## Description
A fullstack e-commerce, Maven Springboot RESTful API application where you as a registered user can buy <i>super</i> random stuff. The application uses both a frontend and a backend in multiple modules.

The backend is built with Java and Springboot and the frontend with Thymeleaf and HTML. The application uses a MySQL database to store data.

Other features in the project are Spring Security, JWT, various Unittests, CSS and Javascript.

## What was your motivation?
Aim to build the first fullstack application as a group. Even though prior small to no experience in frontend before.

## Installation
IF, your using IntelliJ IDEA make sure you are using atleast version 2023.2, otherwise div. errors may occur. If they still do, try clearing IntelliJ:s cache and restart.
  
Important!
if you don't have a local MySQL database running on your computer, the application will not start.
you will get an error message that the application cant connect to the database.\

To use the application you need to have a local MySQL database running on your computer.
Download MySQL Community from https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/ and install it.
When you have installed MySQL Community you need to create a database called "Webshop".
The application uses password "root" and username "root" to connect to a local MySQL database.
please alter the password and username in the application.properties file if yours not the same.
You could also mount a Docker image of mySql, for help on how to do this please see the Docker homepage,
or this tutorial https://youtu.be/kphq2TsVRIs?si=wS20hxnnLG2CAxr4
